    "The aim of the exercises in this notebook is to familiarise you with the different steps of evaluating the performance of a simple convolutional neural network (CNN). You will use a real CNN to classify different cell states using image data provided to you. A more sophisticated version of this neural network has been used in recently published research. The architecture of the network is similar to those you will have learnt about in the lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network is able to tell whether a cell is proliferating or dead.  This could be useful to understand whether a drug is effective or not, or to understand the normal cellular behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN has been pre-trained on a dataset of real images from data collected at UCL. This is a very simple CNN, and you are going to assess the performance of it by making predictions of the cell state using image data, and comparing these with your ground truth annotation.  The images that you are provided with are called a 'hold out' set, since they have come from the much larger original data set, but have not been used to train the neural network. The CNN has not 'seen' these data during the training phase, and therefore represent a real test of the performance of the network.  \n",
